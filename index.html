    In a nutshell Design Thinking is about: <i>Taking a human-centered approach to generating innovative ideas and solving problems.</i>
    <p>Design Thinking is a tool that only graphic and industrial designers can use in the workplace:
    This statement is false because Design Thinking approach can be used by anybody in any sector to solve problems in the workplace, in the home and in the community.</p>
    <p>David Kelley, Co-Founder of the IDEO design firm coined the term, “Design Thinking” in 2003</p>
    <p>Design Thinking can be used to identify better, safer ways for firefighters to enter burning building, devise recipes and packaging to keep baked goods fresher, longer during the transportation process and create systems that allow banking professionals to respond to client needs faster (to name a few).</p>
    <p>The Design Thinking process is Dynamic, with the target user at the heart of every step.</p>

      <dt><b>Empathize</b></dt>
        <dd>Work to fully understand the experience of the user for whom you are designing. Do this through observation, interaction, and immersing yourself in their experiences.</dd>
      <dt><b>Define</b></dt>
        <dd>Process and synthesize the findings from your empathy work in order to form a user point of view that you will address with your design.</dd>
      <dt><b>Ideate</b></dt>
        <dd>Explore a wide variety of possible solutions, allowing you to step beyond the obvious and explore a range of ideas.<dd>
      <dt><b>prototype</b></dt>
        <dd>Transform your ideas into a physical form so that you can experience and interact with them and, in the process, learn and develop more empathy.</dd>
      <dt><b>Test</b></dt>
        <dd>Try out high-resolution products and use observations and feedback to refine prototypes, learn more about the user, and refine your original point of view.</dd>

        <ol>
          <li><i>Show Don't Tell</i> - Communicate your vision in a meaningful and impactful way</li>
          <li><i>Focus on Human Values</i> - Empathy for people you are designing for and feedback from these users</li>
          <li><i>Craft Clarity</i> - Fram a coherent vision of the problem</li>
          <li><i>Embrace Experimentation</i> - Build a prototype to validate an idea, to think, and to learn</li>
          <li><i>Be Mindful of Process</i> - Know what your gioals and methods are</li>
          <li><i>Radical Collaboration</i> - Bring together a diverse group of collaborators and innovators with various perspectives on the problem</li>
          <li><i>Bias Towards Action</i> - Work towards doing and making, not just thinking and meeting</li>

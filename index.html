    <p>Design Thinking is a tool that only graphic and industrial designers can use in the workplace:
    This statement is false because Design Thinking approach can be used by anybody in any sector to solve problems in the workplace, in the home and in the community.</p>
    <p>David Kelley, Co-Founder of the IDEO design firm coined the term, “Design Thinking” in 2003</p>
    <p>Design Thinking can be used to identify better, safer ways for firefighters to enter burning building, devise recipes and packaging to keep baked goods fresher, longer during the transportation process and create systems that allow banking professionals to respond to client needs faster (to name a few).</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Empathize</dt>
        <dd>Work to fully understand the experience of the user for whom you are designing. Do this through observation, interaction, and immersing yourself in their experiences.</dd>
      <dt>Define</dt>
        <dd>Process and synthesize the findings from your empathy work in order to form a user point of view that you will address with your design.</dd>
      <dt>Ideate</dt>
        <dd>Explore a wide variety of possible solutions, allowing you to step beyond the obvious and explore a range of ideas.<dd>
      <dt><b>Test</b></dt>
        <dd>Try out high-resolution products and use observations and feedback to refine prototypes, learn more about the user, and refine your original point of view.</dd>
